# Competitive-Programming
Includes solutions to some computer science problems of my choice.

CoinChange.cpp: A console based C++ program to solve the well-known coin change problem, given a set of coins and a target amount of money, this program computes the way of changing this money with the smallest number of coins. The code provides two different implementations of the solution, one uses dynamic programming aproach and the other uses recursive memoization.

knightMoves.cpp: A console based C++ program to solve the well-known problem "Knight Moves". To be brief, the program performs a variation of the BFS algorithm on a chessboard and finds the smallest possible number of moves a knight should take in order to reach a specified square from its current position.
